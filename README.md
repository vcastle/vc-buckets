# Bucket Challenge

Given a lake of water, an oddly shaped small (Ex: 3 unit) container (A) and an oddly shaped large (Ex: 5 unit) container (B), find the most efficient steps to get the goal (Ex: 4 units) amount of water (C).

Built with `ReactJS` to solve Bucket challenge using the `Breadth-First Search` and `Queue` approach. [Bucket Challenge](https://vcastle.github.io/vc-buckets/).
